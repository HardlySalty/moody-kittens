    The ammount of food you need to give a kitten is dependent of the weight of the kitten
        baby kitten
            2.5 LBS - 160cal
            5 LBS - 360Cal
        adult kitten
            5 LBS - 360cal
            10 LBS - 540cal
            15 LBS - 740cal

Hunger / Food✔
        150 - exploded - Dies
        125 - way to full - a lot of happiness every x time interval
        110 - too full - happiness every x time interval
        100 - full + happiness every x time interval
        75  - content
        50  - hungry - happiness every x time interval
        25  - starving - a lot of happiness every x time interval
        0 - starves to death - Dies
    Food is a set ammount of filling deppending on type and ammount of food
       types of food & ammounts
            Dry Kibble
                1/8 cup 30  calories
                1/4 cup 60  calories
                1/2 cup 120 calories
                 1  cup 240 calories
            Wet Food
                1/8 can 45  calories
                1/4 can 90  calories
                1/2 can 180 calories
                 1  can 360 calories

MATH for feeding  ✔
    if a baby kitten that weighs 2.5 LBS and needs 160 calories (has a 20calorie saftey net over and under)
    you feed him 1/2 cup of dry kibble that would make him full or hunger would = 100
    over 150 calories makes them dead
    over 100 calories makes them way to full 
    over 20 calories makes their stomach hurt
    under 20 calories makes them content
    under 50 makes them hungry
    under 90 makes them starving
    under 125 makes them dead

    so with that all in mind 

    overfeeding works like this

    current calories = 0
    fed 200
        Next day

    cats stomach hurts
    current calories = 40
    feed 120

      case(afterDayCalories > 20 && afterDayCalories < 50):            afterDayCalories + 20 < 50 = -5happiness
